            <p class=" text-info">Web designers should be mindful of the security risks when designing business websites. After all, they play a pivotal role in protecting their clients as well as those who eventually use the sites they are building.

                However, there’s a significant number of designers and developers who believe that their work only revolves around the website’s functionality and appearance. They also believe that security and privacy are not their primary area of concern.
                
                But a website is more than just a beautifully crafted collection of interactive features. It’s also a gateway to a user’s private information, online patterns, and preferences. If this information lands in the wrong hands, it can lead to unprecedented loss and inconvenience. </p>
